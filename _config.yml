resume_header_intro: "<p>I am an eager young professional who builds data science and automation solutions to increase the efficiency of business processes. </p>

<p> After following the Honors program ‘Big Data’ next to my Bachelor of Industrial Engineering, I got hooked on programming and data science. Therefore, the move to study the Data Science & Entrepreneurship Master at JADS in ‘s-Hertogenbosch was the absolute best choice I could make. By combining Business and IT, this Master’s program learns to find new markets and opportunities using (Big) data. After my Master's I decided to join Xccelerated, an innovative 13-month development program for Data Scientists who already have some work experience. </p>

<p> The fast-growing field of Data Science attracts me the most. As a Data Scientist, I am always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. My ambition is to improve decision-making and business processes in a data-driven way.
