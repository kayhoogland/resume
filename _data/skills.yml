    <p> My preferred language to write code in is Python. I picked up Python in 2015 with the course 
    'Programming for Everybody' on Coursera and I am hooked to the language ever since. Over the years I learned new skills 
    mostly by trying out things in projects. My skill level in Python really took a jump in the Xccelerated bootcamp in 
    which was learned how to write scalable code; ready for production.</p> <p>Technologies:</p>

# Expectation management
- skill: Communication

    With all the hype around artificial intelligence nowadays, I deem it important to manage expectations of stakeholders well. 
    To manage expectations, communication skills are crucial for a Data Scientist. 
    In both my Master studies, thesis, and first work experience I trained myself to communicate in a clear way but also 
    to listen well to what someone else has to say.

    Life-long learning is something that keeps me motivated in both my work life as in my personal life. 
    Learning something new gives me energy and I desire to learn something new every day.
