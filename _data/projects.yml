  description: For a long time I was searching for a hobby project to implement in Python until my girlfriend introduced me to the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala" itemprop="url"> Mancala </a>. It's an old two-player game with simple rules that requires a good strategy to beat your opponent. Hence, the perfect game to implement in Python. I started this project on my own but a colleague and former classmate liked it so much that we proceeded together. Our goal is to make this into a proper open-source project.

  description: Greenhouse Group has a large creative department for which graphic designers create content. For one of their clients, Kruidvat, graphic designers create product compositions for internet advertisements. According to designers, this is boring and repetitive work that they would preferably not put their focus on. </p><p> For my Master thesis I developed a system in collaboration with a software engineer that co-creates product compositions for online advertisements with a graphic designer. <p>Watch my talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyFL0BVAGQo" itemprop="url">PyData Amsterdam 2018</a></p>

  description: <p>Ascom builds technological solutions for senior healthcare. Using sensory data, their systems check where a patient is located (bed, room, bathroom or outside). A rule-based system decides whether a location transition should be alarmed or not. In case of an alarm, someone remotely watches a video stream of the room to see if the patient requires care from the caregiver.</p><p>For my bachelor thesis I build a classification model that predicts if a patient requires care from a caregiver in case of an alarm. If the model predicts true, watching the video stream is skipped and a caregiver is sent to the patient right away. </p>
